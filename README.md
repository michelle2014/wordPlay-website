We’ll write a web app called wordPlay that allows users to create a new word they learned, bookmark as they learn about each word, and search for words they’re interested in. The wordPlay home page should display all words created and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new words, add new meanings, synonyms, antonyms, quotations (or optionally images or videos), comment on meanings and quotations created by other users, track and edit existing word entries created by themselves, and like words created or quotations thereof added by other users.
